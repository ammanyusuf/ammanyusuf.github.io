Computer scientist coding away ... 🧑‍💻🤺

I am Amman, born in Italy 🇮🇹, currently living in Cowtown Canada 🇨🇦. My interest in coding started in my high
school robotics class where I coded up battle bots (with Arduino brains) to duke it out in a high-stakes
tournament. From there, my passion in coding blossomed at the University of Calgary, where I graduated first
class. Through my degree I took on various projects and internships. While varied, the common theme between
my experience is challenging, interesting, and fulfilling work.

I started developing websites (I still do) in my first role, which got me involved in AWS, which then got
working with data in my data science role, which opened up my interest in machine learning, which got me
interested in computer vision and deep learning, which culminated (so far) in my final year thesis project
in Federated Learning. Apart from work experience, I still have a great interest in distributed applications
and theory. One of my favourite courses from my degree was "Introduction to Distributed Algorithms" where we
proved the correctness of distributed algorithms. It was a delight understanding how the algorithms work and
the proofs at the end were no short of amazing.

I'm currently part of Dr. Mijung Park's lab on privacy and safety as an MSc student
([Park Lab](https://parklabml.github.io/)).

Current interests: diffusion models, text diffusion models, privacy, safety, and responsible AI.

I attended the CIFAR Deep Learning + Reinforcement Learning (DLRL) Summer School hosted by Amii, where I
focused on reinforcement learning, heard talks from Adam White, Marlos Machado, Martha White, and Richard
Sutton, explored KAN networks in RL settings, and made strong connections across the international deep
learning community.

Previously, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Tamer Jarada (internship - machine learning for healthcare
data) and Dr. Farhad Maleki (bachelor's honours thesis - federated learning and computer vision).

I also worked at [EV.com](https://ev.com/) under the supervision of Haoxu Wang, where I refined my software development skills
and started working on [CarAI](https://www.carai.com/) (a voice agent) using RAG, GraphRAG, LLMs, and voice
agent systems.

Outside of work, I fenced with the University of Calgary Fencing Club as a sabre fencer and helped with
volunteering, teaching, and coaching.
