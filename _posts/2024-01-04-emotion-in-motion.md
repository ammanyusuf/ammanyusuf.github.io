## Key takeaways

We explored the intersection of robotics, emotions, and human-robot interaction through a user elicitation
study with Sony Toio robots. Participants generated motions to convey emotion, and we analyzed distance and
speed features to extract patterns. The project strengthened my UI/UX research skills and highlighted how motion
can bridge emotional communication for non-anthropomorphic robots.

## Abstract

Non-anthropomorphic robots lack human-like expressions, so motion becomes a key communication channel. This
study focused on user-defined motions and the emotions those motions convey. Participants controlled robots by
hand and created movements for eight emotions. The resulting patterns offer insights into designing more
expressive robots for social settings.

## Methodology

We ran ideation sessions and recorded motion data. Plutchik's model guided emotion selection, expanding beyond
Ekman's six basic emotions. We extracted features (distance, speed) and analyzed patterns across emotions.

## Results

Distinct movement patterns emerged for different emotions. These patterns can inform motion-based emotional
expressions in non-anthropomorphic robots.

## Conclusion

By uncovering relationships between movement and emotional perception, we can design better interactions
between people and robots.
