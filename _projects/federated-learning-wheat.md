---

A thesis project exploring distributed computer vision training across multiple clients without centralizing data.

Highlights:
- Benchmarked against centralized baselines with IoU and Dice scores up to 95%.
- Built data transformation and cleaning pipelines for heterogeneous wheat imagery.
- Used a model-agnostic design to compare FL strategies.

Tools: PyTorch, U-Net, Distributed ML
