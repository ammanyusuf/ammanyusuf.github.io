published: false
---

Planned write-up about exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) in reinforcement learning tasks and whether
there is any noticeable improvement.

Topics to cover:

- KAN architecture overview and intuition
- RL tasks evaluated and baselines
- Metrics and observations
- Practical takeaways
