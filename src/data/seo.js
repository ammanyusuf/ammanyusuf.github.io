			"Through my degree I took on various projects and internships. While varied, the common theme between my experience is challenging, interesting, and fulfilling work. " + 
			"I started developing websites (I still do) in my first role, which got me involved in AWS, which then got working with data in my data science role, which opened up my " +
			"interest in machine learning, which got me interested in computer vision and deep learning, which culminated (so far) in my final year thesis project in Federated Learning. " +
			"Apart from work experience, I still have a great interest in distributed applications and theory. One of my favourite courses from my degree was 'Introduction to Distributed Algorithms " + 
			"where we proved the correctness of distributed algorithms. It was a delight understanding how the algorithms work and the proofs at the end were no short of amazing.",
